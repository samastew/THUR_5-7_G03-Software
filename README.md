Assistive tools, including artificial intelligence and large language models, were used in the preparation of this KSAMC E-Portal project submission to:

Enhance Technical Implementation: AI-assisted tools were utilized to develop and refine CSS styling templates and responsive design frameworks that form the visual foundation of the web application, ensuring professional presentation and user-friendly interfaces.
Support Code Development: AI tools assisted in completing and implementing JavaScript functions, particularly for complex features including form validation, localStorage data management, and dynamic UI updates, while maintaining code consistency and best practices.

All final architectural decisions, code implementations, design choices, and structural organization were determined, evaluated, and approved by Joshua Chiverton and Samara Stewart
